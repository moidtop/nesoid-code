# nesoid-code

Version 2.5
	This version claims to have network support, but it is unclear 
	whether or not it really works. Otherwise it looks fine.

If you own newer version of Nesoid, please inform me. Your help 
in form of e-mailing author and requesting it's sources is 
highly welcome.

Note: provided apk may be built with some patches, not present in 
source repository. All such patches can be found at FDroid project site: 
http://f-droid.org.
